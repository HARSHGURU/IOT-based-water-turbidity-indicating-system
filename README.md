# IOT-based-water-turbidity-indicating-system
IoT-based water turbidity indicating system represents a significant advancement in the field of water quality monitoring. Through its accurate measurements, real-time data transmission, and cloud-based storage and visualization, the system offers a practical and effective solution for monitoring and analyzing water turbidity.

Description:
1. Turbidity Sensor: This sensor measures the level of turbidity or cloudiness in a liquid. It
provides an input to the controller, indicating the turbidity level of the liquid being monitored.

2. Controller: The controller receives the input from the turbidity sensor and processes it. It
performs the necessary calculations or logic operations based on the input data to determine
the desired result.

3. 16*2 LCD Screen: The controller sends the processed result to the LCD screen for display.
The 16*2 LCD screen provides a visual output, allowing users to view the result directly.

4. ESP8266-01 Wi-Fi Module: This module enables wireless communication between the
controller and the IoT cloud server. It connects to the local Wi-Fi network and facilitates data
transmission over the internet.

5. IoT Cloud Server (ThingSpeak): The ESP8266-01 module sends the processed data to the
ThingSpeak IoT cloud server. ThingSpeak is an IoT platform that allows you to collect,
analyze, and visualize sensor data. It acts as a central repository for the data sent by the
controller. The ThingSpeak IoT website provides a user interface to access and view the data
sent by the controller. Users can log in to the website and observe the result displayed in a
graphical or tabular format, depending on the visualization settings.
